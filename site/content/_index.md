    text1: "In one in three Islington households, no-one is employed. Over half of single parents in the borough are out of work. Just a fifth are in full employment. It is highly overpopulated, with triple as many people per square metre as the average London borough. It’s also full of young people with drive, creativity, ideas – and enormous potential."
    text2: "But without safe spaces, playgrounds, or youth centres, they have nowhere to grow. And without the financial freedom to travel to other areas of the city, they cannot benefit from better local provisions elsewhere. We don’t want their energy and ambitions to go to waste."

      text: "Young people want places to go. In Islington, they have a number of options, but few of them are free. Community centres in estates have been closed, or are being redeveloped. Many  don’t feel safe travelling to the places which remain open because of high incidence of crime or antisocial behaviour. Prospex gives them somewhere to learn, play, or just relax – closer to home."

      text: "Our youth hubs offer a safe space for young people to meet new people and learn new skills in an environment designed to promote positive wellbeing. We have a ‘Healthy Bodies, Healthy Minds’ approach – stimulating both the physical body, and the mind. We run regular cooking, arts, team building and sports sessions, coupled with trips to the countryside."
