  A youth club in every neighbourhood to tackle teenage delinquency is the latest government pledge. But do they really stop young people getting into trouble?

Youths in Britain are more likely to drink, take drugs, have sex, join gangs and get into fights than almost anywhere else in Europe, new figures show.

Published by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), they come just as the government announces its new 10-year youth strategy to tackle teenage delinquency which calls for a youth club in every neighbourhood.

>The lack of "somewhere to go in the evening" is a stock grievance among many teenagers and often cited as a reason for them going off the rails. But research shows simply giving them a base to meet and socialise can do more harm than good.

Just hanging out at a club can have a detrimental impact on young people's lives, making them more likely to smoke, drink and become teenage parents, according to recent study, also by the IPPR.

However, youth clubs can be improving when structured activities such as sport, art or drama are laid on. Youth activities that take place regularly, in a group setting, with a clear hierarchy and well defined aims help children to develop better social and emotional skills, the study says. They can also offer structure to children who lack it at home.

Children's minister Beverley Hughes says she would seek to encourage "positive activities that are attractive" to young folk.

## 'Asking for trouble'

"Every child should be expected to do at least an hour a week of constructive after-school activities," says Julia Margo, Senior Research Fellow with the IPPR.

Other research supports the theory that a youth club which is little more than a hut with a pool table and darts board can be corrupting. A study by the University of London's Institute of Education for the Department for Education and Skills tracked a group of people born in 1970 to examine the impact of youth activities over time.

It concluded giving young people a place to hang out without organised activities, or effective supervision, is damaging. Young people not only need places to go but things to do, the report said.

One well-respected youth worker who agrees that children need more than just a building in which to meet is Mick Jelley. He has run Bury Amateur Boxing Club for over 40 years on a voluntary basis.

He nurtured Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan from the age of eight. Khan has now turned professional and won the Commonwealth lightweight title last week.

>"Just providing a physical structure for kids to meet in is not enough. You need to add structure to their lives. If you just put a pool table in a room you are asking for trouble.

## Friendship

"You have to get them doing something, which they have to commit to and attend regularly. Through that you build a friendship with them, then you teach them about discipline and respect - for themselves and others.

A youth worker from south London says the relationship you build with the youngsters is even more important than the activities on offer.

"You can have a brand new computer suite but if the youth workers don't build a relationship with the kids they will not come and use it.

"I've worked in clubs that have had little more than a pool table and they've been really successful because the staff get to know the kids and are their friends. At the end of the day, that's what will make the difference in these youngster's lives."
