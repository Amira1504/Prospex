      We work with young people who may be at risk of falling into a lifestyle of knife crime,
      drugs and violence, creating opportunities to realise and fulfill their potential.
      Our service takes young people on their own Prospex journey with a commitment to
      always putting young people first. We offer street outreach, junior and senior sessions,
      girls club, holiday schemes and accredited learning. Click on the 'Donate' button on the right-hand side of the page to donate today!

    text: >
      Islington is one of the poorest boroughs with many families living in poverty and a high
      crime rate. Our support goes beyond the young person, and includes local families and the wider community.
      Our work helps to reduce anti-social behaviour by encouraging young people to improve life and employment
      skills through our projects and help to create opportunities. If young people are able to positively
      contribute to their local community this helps to create community cohesion.

    text: >
      Prospex inspires young people to see beyond their current circumstances, giving them the
      tools they will need to move forward and make decisions for themselves that will help
      them become valuable members of their communities. Our outcomes include young people returning to mainstream education,
      gaining employment and leadership skills, rejecting gang culture, gaining new experiences,
      developing leadership skills, making friends, improving self-esteem and confidence to make positive life choices..
