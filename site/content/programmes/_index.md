        One2One Programme: We allocate young people a Dedicated One2One worker based on their needs and circumstances. Our One2one work could range from a few sessions helping a young person complete a application form, to many years working with them and their families to help overcome a range of complex issues which, together, can have a serious impact on their wellbeing.

        Centre-based Programme: Our Centre is open for young people aged 8 to 24. Three times a week we not only teach the young people how to make a nutritious meal, but we also encourage them to sit and enjoy their dinner together. Once a week, we offer an empowerment session for girls, and as of 2019 this will be extended to a boys session also.

        Street Teams: Our Street Teams exist to make sure young people are safe and well, wherever they are. If theyâ€™d rather not come to the centre, our staff check in on them in their local area. This builds a mutual trust and allows positive relationships to be formed. Our team become familiar faces, and get to know the wider community as well as the young people themselves.

       Our teams have diffused volatile situations on the streets amongst young people and their communities. Early interventions like this help improve relationships amongst different groups and generations in the areas we work in, as well as the young people themselves. This has helped to reduce antisocial behavior and the criminalisation of young people in the areas we cover.

    Islington lacks interesting, engaging, open, free spaces for young people to spend their time outside. In certain instances, young people become entrenched in gang culture and unwilling to move into new, unfamiliar spaces because of shyness, wariness, or safety issues. We have three approaches to help address this: Street Teams, One2One's and Centre-based programmes.

  heading: About us
  description: >-
     Prospex is an award-winning grassroots youth charity based in Islington, supporting young people aged 8-21 whose life chances are affected through measures outside their control; poverty, social deprivation, high unemployment and crime. Founded in 2001, the organisation works to address these negative influences, often resulting in low self-esteem and poor school attendance, leading to limited employment prospects.  We establish positive relationships and provide opportunities, build life and employability skills. Young people are able to broaden their horizons outside the limits of their existing thinking and are given the tools to achieve their goals.
